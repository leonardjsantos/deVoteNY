    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to DeVOTE NY (Defeating Violence and Oppression Through Education in New York). This page was created by the Coalition for a Future Without Violence, a collective of NYU Grad Students with the common goal of creating a loving society.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe a world without violence and oppression begins with education, so our objective is to get New York State Residents to contact your representatives and ask them to support Bills S4844 & A6512 to mandate “comprehensive sexuality instruction for students in grades K-12 which addresses age and developmentally appropriate physical, mental, emotional and social dimensions of human sexuality and reflects the national sexuality education standards.” This would also include lessons to prevent violence and oppression.
    </p>

    <p>
      NY State Residents, click ACT to learn more about what you can do to help pass these bills!
    </p>

    <p>
      Non-Residents, you can support by spreading the word! Share our page, follow our social accounts, and help boost our content!
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you in advance for taking action!
    </p>

    <p>
      In Solidarity,
    </p>
