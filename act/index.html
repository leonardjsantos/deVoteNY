      <h3>2. CALL</h3>
      <h4>Call your Senator + Assemblymember to ask them to support Bill S4844/A6512!</h4>
      <p>
        Calling is the most effective form of contacting your representatives. Even if no one answers, be sure to leave a voicemail as the message will still be received! View our sample call script below:
      </p>
      <div class="actScript">
        <p>
          Hi, my name is [name] and I’m calling from [city and zip code] to urge [representative’s name] to support Assembly Bill A6512 / Senate Bill S4844.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, New York State does not require comprehensive sexuality  education in schools, and this legislation would change that. This is important for the health, safety, and well-being of our children as well as our community at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly support Bill A6512/S4844, I want it to be voted on, and I urge [representative’s name] to sponsor and support this legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you!

      <h3>3. EMAIL</h3>
      <h4>Email your Senator + Assemblymember to ask them to support Bill S4844/A6512! </h4>
      <p>
        Emails are the second most effective way to contact your representatives! Remember to send one to your Senator and one to your Assemblymember, since we want this to pass both the Senate and the Assembly! View our sample email script below:
